**GitPress Collection** is useful for the better content arrangement.

Use **GitPress Collection** whenâ€¦

1. Some articles have the same topic. For example, a book or a tutorial, like this collection.
2. You want to collaborate with other people, but don't want to share them commit permission of your personal article repo.
3. You want to sale collection as E-book at GitPress(in the future)

[GitPress Help](https://gitpress.io/c/12/welcome) is a regular collection. It contains some markdown files and a `TOC.md` file. Markdown files will render to HTML like articles. `TOC.md` will render to collection's table of content.
