**GitPress Collection** is useful for the better content arrangement.

Use **GitPress Collection** whenâ€¦

1. Posts have the same topic. For example, a book or a tutorial, like this collection.
2. You want to collaborate with other people, but don't want to share them commit permission of your personal repo.
3. You want to sale collection as E-book at GitPress(in the future)

[GitPress Help](https://gitpress.io/c/helps/welcome) is a regular collection. It contains some markdown files and a `TOC.md` file. 

Markdown files will be transform to posts. `TOC.md` will be transform to collection's table of content.
